### Pre-review checklist:

- [ ] I have run a spell check on the writeup and made sure no typos exists.
- [ ] References to Snapshot/governance forum are correct on the AIP. If no snapshot exists, make sure no TODO's exists.
- [ ] The specification on the writeup is aligned with the forum, snapshot and the payload contract. If there are any changes, they are explicitly mentioned/communicated.
- [ ] Minimal tests exist, and the snapshot diff report generated is the latest one and aligned with the payload.
- [ ] If deploy scripts are manually updated from the generated ones, I have carefully validated that they are correct, including the deploy commands and the proposal-creation script.
- [ ] If aave-helpers submodule is updated, I have validated it is pointing to the latest version.
- [ ] I have validated there are no unused files and imports being added.
- [ ] For an asset listing, the writeup includes a detailed specification of the price feed used, CAPO adapters (with each CAPO layer described separately), and eModes (with tables) if changed.
- [ ] Wherever possible, I have validated addresses from address-book is used instead of raw addresses.
