### Pre-review checklist:

- [ ] I have run a spell check on the writeup and made sure no typos exists.
- [ ] References to Snapshot/governance forum are correct on the AIP. If no snapshot exists, make sure no TODO's exists.
- [ ] The specification on the writeup is aligned with the forum, snapshot and the payload contract. If any change, it is explicitly mentioned / communicated.
- [ ] Minimal tests exists, and the snapshot diff report generated is the latest one and aligned with the payload.
- [ ] If deploy scripts are updated manually from the generated one, I have validated carefully it is correct, including the commands to deploy and proposal creation script.
- [ ] If aave-helpers submodule is updated, I have validated it is pointing to the latest version.
- [ ] I have validated there are no unused files and imports being added.
- [ ] For an asset listing, there exists detailed specification on the writeup about the price feed being used, and about eModes with tables if being changed.
- [ ] Wherever possible, I have validated addresses from address-book is used instead of raw addresses.
