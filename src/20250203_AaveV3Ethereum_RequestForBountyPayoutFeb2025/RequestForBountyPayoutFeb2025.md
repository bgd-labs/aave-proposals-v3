## Simple Summary

Proposal to release a total of $61’000 as bounty for four outstanding Aave <> Immunefi valid submissions, together with $6’100 as the fee to the Immunefi platform; amounting to a grand total of $67’100.

The asset of payment will be GHO.

## Motivation

After the previous Request for Bounty Payout on September 2024, there have been only four valid bug submissions on the Aave <> Immunefi program, which should be paid now with the month finished, cleaning up the pipeline.

## Specification

This proposal will release the following funds to white-hat addresses and the Immunefi platform:

- 10’000 GHO to 0x75a1151D38885461CfA27f8f66927D4fCAD25b55
- 50’000 GHO to 0x0Dca0FDC170baA4CA9c1dCd37Ffe01f97bCfD504 (one bounty of 10'000 GHO and another of 40'000)
- 1’000 GHO to 0x299e532172cce5230192d413D47C6739DB9338fE
- 6’100 GHO to 0x7119f398b6C06095c6E8964C1f58e7C1BAa79E18 (immunefi.eth). This is the fee corresponding to the 10% of the previous bounties.
