## Simple Summary

This proposal aims to enable sUSDe/USDT liquid E-Mode for the Core Instance. By implementing this change, we seek to enhance capital efficiency for borrowers using sUSDe as collateral, specifically for borrowing USDT. This is a Direct to AIP Proposal.

## Motivation

sUSDe has demonstrated significant usage as collateral for borrowing stablecoins and to increase borrowing options we now look to enable E-Mode for USDT borrows against sUSDe.

By implementing this proposal, we aim to optimize the use of sUSDe within the Aave ecosystem, attracting more liquidity and providing more options for both borrowers and lenders.

## Specification

USDT on the Core instance will be added to the sUSDe stablecoin E-Mode
