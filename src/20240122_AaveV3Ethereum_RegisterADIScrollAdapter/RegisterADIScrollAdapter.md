## Simple Summary

Proposal to register the scroll adapter on Ethereum a.DI

## Motivation

For the Aave DAO to have control of the Aave Protocol deployed in the Scroll network, a Scroll adapter needs to be
registered in the Ethereum a.DI that is configured for the communication with the Scroll network a.DI.

## Specification

The proposal registers a pre-deployed Scroll adapter (with the necessary configurations to communicate with the Scroll a.DI) on the Ethereum a.DI.
