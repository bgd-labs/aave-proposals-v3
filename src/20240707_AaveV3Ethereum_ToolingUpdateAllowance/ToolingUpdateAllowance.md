## Simple Summary

As per the forum vote that contracted TokenLogic to develop various smart contracts to help with treasury management by bridging funds from multiple networks, after having the DAO utilize these solutions we are seeking payment for the work performed.

## Motivation

To ensure the Aave DAO's financial stability and the ability to transfer assets across different networks through the shortExecutor, it is crucial to establish equivalent contracts for other networks. One such scenario involves moving USDC from Avalanche to Ethereum, effectively extending the DAO's stable coin runway.

## Specification

Set an allowance of 12,000 GHO to TokenLogic.
