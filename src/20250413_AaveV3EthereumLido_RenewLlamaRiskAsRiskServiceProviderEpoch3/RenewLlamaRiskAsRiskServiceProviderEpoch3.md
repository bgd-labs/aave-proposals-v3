## Simple Summary

This proposal offers the opportunity to renew LLamaRisk engagement as a service provider for a year.

## Motivation

> LlamaRisk submits this proposal to renew our role as an Aave Service Provider. Over the past year, we have delivered consistent value to the DAO through independent risk analysis and proactive contributions to Aave’s security and strategic decision-making. We cherish the opportunity to work for an organization that encourages public debate and believe that retaining the services of two risk providers is part of Aave’s moat.
>
> For this next epoch, we propose a service fee of $1m for one year, a 25% increase from the previous term. This adjustment reflects our expanded engagement, the need to retain specialized talent dedicated to Aave’s risk management, and our commitment to upholding the highest service standards.
>
> Our contributions are fully transparent and verifiable through our daily engagement on the [forum](https://governance.aave.com/u/llamarisk/activity), monthly [community updates](https://governance.aave.com/t/llamarisk-monthly-community-update/17935), and [research publications](https://www.llamarisk.com/research). Below, we review our key achievements in Epoch 2 and outline our vision for this renewal.

> **Community engagement**:
>
> - Launched [This Week In Aave](https://x.com/aaveweekly), a weekly X thread summarizing protocol developments.
>
> ## Scope
>
> Building on [Epoch 2’s foundation](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-renew-llamarisk-as-risk-service-provider/19277), we will continue centering our services to Aave DAO around producing in-depth and actionable risk assessments in recommendations for all current and prospective assets on Aave instances. We will continue working closely with other service providers, especially @ChaosLabs, ensuring comprehensive risk coverage and prioritize the following strategic initiatives:
>
> - **Umbrella parametrization**: Provide dedicated support as members of the newly established [Aave Finance Committee](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aavenomics-implementation-part-one/21248), applying our data-driven capitalization methodology developed through months of research. This approach uses rigorous analysis of market-wide price shocks to determine optimal insurance caps
> - **Smart Value Recapture (SVR)**: Support and monitor SVR implementation.
> - **RWA collaboration**: Work with @AaveLabs on the Horizon program, leveraging our domain expertise in RWA risk assessment.
> - **Aptos Deployment**: Support Aave’s expansion to Aptos with a comprehensive risk analysis of the ecosystem.
> - **sGHO**: Continue supporting the GHO Savings rollout, building on our GSM fee methodology work. We’ll provide risk parametrization and supply target estimations to support @TokenLogic and @kpk’s integration plans.
>
> We propose a 1-year term to underscore our long-term commitment to Aave DAO—performance will dictate continuity.
