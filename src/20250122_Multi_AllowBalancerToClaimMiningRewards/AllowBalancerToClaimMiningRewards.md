## Simple Summary

This publication proposes allowing the Balancer DAO to claim liquidity mining rewards generated by Balancer v3 Boosted Pools through the Aave Protocol.

## Motivation

With the launch of Balancer v3, the new Boosted Pool type allocates some or all tokens to generate additional yield for liquidity providers, primarily through deposits into the Aave Protocol. Yield-bearing tokens can comprise 25% to 100% of a Boosted Pool's total liquidity.

This proposal enables the Balancer DAO to retrieve liquidity mining rewards from Boosted Pools for redistribution to users and the DAO.

To facilitate this, Aave Protocol’s claimOnBehalfOf function allows designated addresses to claim rewards on behalf of smart contracts.

Without assigning a specific address as the contract owner, these rewards cannot be claimed, leaving them inaccessible.

## Specification

Set Balancer contract `0x9ff471F9f98F42E5151C7855fD1b5aa906b1AF7e` as the claimer (caller) on behalf of the Balancer v3 vault as the user `0xbA1333333333a1BA1108E8412f11850A5C319bA9`, on both Ethereum Core and Gnosis.
