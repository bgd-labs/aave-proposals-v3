## Simple Summary

Proposal to release a total of $21’000 as bounty for four outstanding Aave <> Immunefi valid submissions, together with $2’100 as the fee to the Immunefi platform; amounting to a grand total of $23'100.

The asset of payment will be GHO.

## Motivation

After the previous Request for Bounty Payout on January 2025, there have been only two valid bug submissions on the Aave <> Immunefi program, which should be paid now with the month finished, cleaning up the pipeline.

## Specification

This proposal will release the following funds to white-hat addresses and the Immunefi platform:

- 20’000 GHO to 0x62566e81CcDFF9407E840d5ec3056e7354D44012
- 1’000 GHO to 0xF5BED21BD285CBe352737F686766cCC19BeE7acC
- 2’100 GHO to 0x7119f398b6C06095c6E8964C1f58e7C1BAa79E18 (immunefi.eth). This is the fee corresponding to the 10% of the previous bounties.
