## Simple Summary

Proposing the renewal of the Orbit program for recognized delegates, compensating them with GHO, associated with their governance activity during Q1 2025 ( From 2024-12-14, last date, until 2025-03-31).

## Motivation

Orbit recognizes the added value of the Delegates in the decentralization & diversity of the Aave DAO. This compensation allows them to focus on Aave and keep their contribution efforts to our governance. The ACI proposes the extension of Orbit for a new quarter, Q1 2025, from 2024-12-14 to 2025-03-31.

From now on, all renews will be applied strictly by Quarters, and a new cutoff has been set on [AIP 224](https://vote.onaave.com/proposal/?proposalId=224&ipfsHash=0xa4da1c686491e35541aa7e2659d55d0b93e395a89d1b268981aec3b8b2227bc1), to apply again previous rules of a minimum of 20k voting power and 85% vote ratio on all Snapshots and AIP to be considered elegible to Orbit.
