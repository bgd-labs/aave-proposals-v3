The initial 6-month engagement, which may be extended pending DAO approval, involves the following scope:

- **On-demand Risk Assessments:** LlamaRisk will deliver prompt and in-depth risk assessments for assets listed or considered to be listed on Aave with particular emphasis on the collateral types comprising the GHO stablecoin. This will involve developing a custom framework tailored specifically to the categories of relevant assets and Aave’s needs, which will standardize the assessment process.
- **Collaborative Engagement with Chaos Labs:** We plan to collaborate extensively with Chaos Labs, combining our expertise to provide Aave with comprehensive and nuanced risk analysis, enhancing the protocol’s risk management capacity.
- **Active Involvement in DAO Governance:** LlamaRisk will actively participate in Aave’s DAO governance, offering informed insights and strategic recommendations on risk management practices for principal stakeholders and the community.
- **Legal Regulatory Advisory and Policy Work:** We will offer specialized legal research and regulatory guidance, including a thorough analysis of evolving legal frameworks and regulatory policies, and equip Aave with the necessary foresight to navigate the regulatory landscape of the DeFi sector effectively.

LlamaRisk leverages advanced simulation techniques, including statistical and agent-based modeling, to test and validate DeFi protocols and their collateral assets under various stress scenarios. Our simulations provide valuable insights into potential risks, allowing our partner protocols to set competitive parameters resilient to adverse market conditions.

Our DeFi strategy managers employ data analytics and risk monitoring tools that allow us to maintain high efficiency and safety standards. We support our partners with publications and dashboards that give users the information they need to interact with the protocol responsibly.
