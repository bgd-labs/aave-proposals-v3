## Simple Summary

This proposal will upgrade all active Aave instances to version v3.3.0.

## Motivation

Back in december we(BGD Labs) [proposed](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-3-feat-umbrella/20129) the Aave v3.3.0 upgrade which improves the liquidation engine, to support the previously proposed [Umbrella](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-safety-module-umbrella/18366) proposal.
With the proposal being executed, the Aave Protocol will start tracking bad debt, which can then be used as an input on Umbrella to slash stakers & cover the realized deficit.

## Specification

This proposal will upgrade all active Aave instances to the new v3.3.0 version.
In practice this means:

1. the pool implementation will be upgraded via a call to `POOL_ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.setPoolImpl(newImpl)`
2. the pool configurator will be upgraded via a call to `POOL_ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.setPoolConfiguratorImpl(poolConfiguratorImpl)`
3. the pool data provider will be replaced via a call to `POOL_ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.setPoolDataProvider(newPoolDataProvider)`

In addition the proposal will transfer 66.400$ in aUSDC to a wallet controlled by BGD to cover audit costs.
