## Simple Summary

This proposal disables stable borrow rate for all assets across all pools on all networks.
In addition, it unfreezes assets that were previously frozen by the freeze steward.

## Motivation

In response to an attack vector reported by a white-hat, some immediate steps where taken to protect the Aave Markets by
pausing and freezing the affected markets.
This proposal will revert the freezings and apply a permanent fix. Un-pausing the applicable pools will be done via Guardian.

## Specification

The proposal calls

- `POOL_CONFIGURATOR.setReserveStableRateBorrowing(asset, false);` for all assets with stable borrowing enabled on v3 pools,
- `POOL_CONFIGURATOR.disableReserveStableRate(asset);` for Ethereum v2 pool, and
- `POOL_CONFIGURATOR.unfreeze(asset)` with all assets previously frozen as risk mitigation measure.
