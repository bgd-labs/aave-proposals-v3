## Simple Summary

This publication proposes restoring ETH’s LTV to 82% on the Prime instance of Aave v3.

## Motivation

With the introduction of liquidity mining rewards for ETH deposits on Prime, some users exploited wETH/wETH leverage to farm rewards. In response, ETH’s LTV was set to 0, preventing new ETH collateral positions while preserving existing user positions.

Transitioning from direct liquidity mining emissions to a periodic Merkl distribution ensures that users leveraging wETH/wETH can be disqualified from rewards. By introducing a qualification criteria, incentives are directed towards users who engage with the protocol as intended.

This proposal focuses on re-enabling ETH collateral positions by restoring the LTV to 82%.

## Specification

The LTV for ETH on Prime is to be amended as outlined below:

| Parameter | Current | Proposed |
| :-------: | :-----: | :------: |
|    LTV    |  0.00%  |  82.00%  |

The ETH Correlated eMode category is to be amended as outlined below:

|      Parameter      | Value  | Value  |
| :-----------------: | :----: | :----: |
|        Asset        |  wETH  | wstETH |
|     Collateral      |   No   |  Yes   |
|     Borrowable      |  Yes   |   No   |
|         LTV         | 93.50% | 93.50% |
|         LT          | 95.50% | 95.50% |
| Liquidation Penalty | 1.00%  | 1.00%  |
