## Simple Summary

Do a fire drill voting flow with a mock governance proposal using Avalanche as the voting network instead of Polygon as usual, to test that all peripheral systems are properly functioning.

## Motivation

Following the same rationale as [the previous proposed fire drill using Ethereum as voting network](https://governance.aave.com/t/technical-maintenance-proposals/15274/91), we think it is beneficial to do the same with Avalanche, the other available network in production, but that has never been used, given that Polygon has worked properly.

## Specification

The governance proposal will be created using the [Ethereum â†’ Avalanche Voting Portal](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9Ded9406f088C10621BE628EEFf40c1DF396c172) so that voting will happen on the Avalanche network.

The payload executed will just contain an empty `execute()` function, as the purpose of this fire drill is testing the full flow, and not any execution content.
