## Simple Summary

Do a fire drill voting flow with a mock governance proposal using Avalanche as the voting network instead of Polygon as usual, to test that all peripheral systems are properly functioning.

## Motivation

Given that the Aave Governance flow has never been used, we think it is healthy to make a fire drill: creating a proposal executing a payload without any meaningful content, but using the Avalanche voting infrastructure.

## Specification

The governance proposal will be created using the [Ethereum â†’ Avalanche Voting Portal](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9Ded9406f088C10621BE628EEFf40c1DF396c172) so that voting will happen on the Avalanche network.

The payload executed will just contain an empty execute() function, as the purpose of this fire drill is testing the full flow, and not any execution content.
