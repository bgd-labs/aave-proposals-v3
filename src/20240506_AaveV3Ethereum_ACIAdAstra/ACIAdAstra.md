## Simple Summary

This ARFC proposes the continuation of the collaboration with the Aave-chan Initiative (ACI) for an additional year, with a proposed budget of 1M GHO.

## Motivation

The ACI has demonstrated significant value to the Aave ecosystem across multiple fronts. The “initiative” launched ~18 months ago is now a team of 8 people strong, including various talents & providing multiple services, contributing to the DAO's success.
This proposal seeks to extend our collaboration for another year.

## Specification

Proposal duration: ~365 Days
Proposal Budget: 1M GHO

Note: this proposal is intended to be a continuation of ACI’s previous streams due to governance mandatory delays to avoid a “gap” in ACI’s engagement, the AIP payload will be adjusted to approximately reflect an engagement from May 5th, 2024 and then for a year after execution.
