## Simple Summary

Proposal to release a total of $1’000 as bounty for one outstanding Aave <> Immunefi valid submission, together with $100 as fee to the Immunefi platform; amounting a grand total of $1’100.

## Motivation

After the previous Request for Bounty Payout on January 2024, there has been only one valid bug submission on the Aave <> Immunefi program, which should be paid now with the month of submission (June) finished.

This proposal covers that bounty, cleaning up the pipeline until today July 1st 2024.

## Specification

This proposal, following an approach similar to Direct-to-AIP, will go directly on-chain and will release the following funds to white-hat addresses and the Immunefi platform:

- $1’000 to 0xeD656e42612177D9c747A16604E07D5C5B031d30.

- $100 to 0x7119f398b6C06095c6E8964C1f58e7C1BAa79E18 (immunefi.eth). This is the fee corresponding to the 10% of the previous bounty.

The asset used for the transfers is GHO.
