## Summary

Gauntlet recommends parameter changes on Polygon Aave v3 market. For more details, see the full forum post [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gauntlet-cap-recommendations-for-polygon-v3-2023-11-03/15327).

## Motivation

Per Gauntletâ€™s supply and borrow cap methodology, we recommend setting supply and borrow caps for agEUR and jEUR. Currently agEUR borrowing is disabled and cannot be used as collateral. jEUR is frozen. Despite this, all assets should have supply and borrow caps.

## Specification

| Chain   | Asset | Cap    | Current | Recommended |
| ------- | ----- | ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| Polygon | agEUR | Supply | -       | 300k        |
| Polygon | agEUR | Borrow | -       | 250k        |
| Polygon | jEUR  | Supply | -       | 120k        |
| Polygon | jEUR  | Borrow | -       | 100k        |
