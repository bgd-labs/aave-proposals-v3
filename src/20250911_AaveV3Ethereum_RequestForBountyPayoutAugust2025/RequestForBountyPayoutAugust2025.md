## Simple Summary

Proposal to release a total of $13’000 as bounty for two outstanding Aave <> Immunefi valid submissions, together with $1’300 as the fee to the Immunefi platform; amounting to a grand total of $14'300.

The asset of payment will be GHO.

## Motivation

After the previous [Request for Bounty Payout in March 2025](https://vote.onaave.com/proposal/?proposalId=290), there have only been two valid submissions on the Aave <> Immunefi program, to be paid now, cleaning up the pipeline until 1st September, 2025.

## Specification

This proposal, following an approach similar to Direct-to-AIP, will go directly on-chain and will release the following funds to white-hat addresses and the Immunefi platform:

- $8’000 to 0xbD5895f2855C3d0B7f366Bd946D56c4D9Ef03a25
- $5’000 to 0x2770cC972a7666C974B1b1269F4F31b97f99f898
- $1’300 to 0x7119f398b6C06095c6E8964C1f58e7C1BAa79E18 (immunefi.eth). This is the fee corresponding to 10% of the previous bounties.
