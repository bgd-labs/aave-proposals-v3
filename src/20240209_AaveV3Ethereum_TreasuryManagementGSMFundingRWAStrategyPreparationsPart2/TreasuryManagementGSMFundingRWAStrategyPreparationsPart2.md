## Simple Summary

In preparation for launching the GHO Stability Module (GSM) and the $1M RWA strategy with Centirfuge, this publication seeks to make available the necessary amount of USDC, USDT and DAI on Ethereum.

This proposal also includes the renewal of the Orbit program for recognized delegates. Compensating them with GHO and ETH reimbursement of Gas costs associated with their governance activity.

## Motivation

The GSM is expected to be available for deployment in the near future. The Centrifuge proposal is currently mid way through the review process. The current stable coin holdings on Ethereum are insufficient to support both the GSM, RWA strategy and Service Provider (SP) commitments. Additional funds are needed on Ethereum to support the GSM.

The Aave DAO possesses significant voting power in various governance tokens. However, the current structure of the collector contract hinders direct participation in other DAOsâ€™ governance. To effectively leverage this power and actively participate in pivotal governance decisions, such as LTIPs on Arbitrum, the creation of APE is essential. Details on the Aave Protocol Embassy can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-establishing-the-aave-protocol-embassy-ape/16445).

The Orbit program Snapshot and discussion can be found [here](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x412b38c7a0cf1840b102e28ea7ef0373e3ab4b9544873e8cc1544972b777d9a1) and [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-orbit-program-renewal/16550) respectively.

The following table outlines the proposed compensation for eligible delegates matching the requirements:

| Delegate Platform | Retro-Payment (GHO) | New Stream (GHO) |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
