## Simple Summary

A proposal to reduce Liquidation Threshold (LT) on Aave V2 Ethereum.

## Motivation

In accordance with the [v2 deprecation framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v2-markets-deprecation-plan/14870), Chaos Labs and Gauntlet advise implementing the subsequent parameter changes to the frozen assets on Aave v2 Ethereum

## LT Reductions

The recommendations below suggest an LT configuration that optimizes reductions without significantly increasing the number of accounts eligible for liquidation. The proposed values are set at a margin of at least ~4% from the closest LT figure, which would trigger more substantial liquidations.

This will affect 20 accounts, leading to a cumulative liquidation of $1,101 in collateral value.

_As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution._
