## Simple Summary

This proposal activates the Risk Stewards on Aave V4 Ethereum and Aave V4 Avalanche, by setting their risk configuration and granting them the AccessManager roles they need to operate.

The bounds (`maxPercentChange`) follow LlamaRisk's recommended configuration, which carries most of them over from the corresponding V3 Risk Stewards unchanged. The cooldowns (`minDelay`) on the interest rate, cap and `collateralRisk` parameters are set to 36 hours, in line with the reduction ratified for the V3 Risk Stewards; every other parameter keeps a 72 hour cooldown, and the Pendle discount rate keeps its 48 hour cooldown.

## Motivation

The V4 Risk Stewards are deployed on both networks but hold no configuration and no permissions, so risk parameter maintenance on V4 still requires a full governance cycle for every change.

Configuring them alongside their V3 counterparts keeps a single risk mandate across protocol versions: the same risk council, and the same limits on how far a single update can move a parameter wherever V4 has a V3 equivalent. The parameters that are new in V4 — `collateralRisk`, the bounds applied when appending a new dynamic reserve config, and the spoke liquidation config — follow LlamaRisk's recommendation, as do the two interest rate parameters they widened relative to their V3 analogs.

`collateralRisk` sits at or near 0 under normal conditions and is bounded absolutely, so it gets a wide 300% bound and the reduced 36 hour cooldown: that combination lets the risk premium be lifted far enough, fast enough, to push borrowers toward repayment inside a single stress window.

The 36 hour cooldowns are applied to both networks so the two V4 Risk Stewards do not diverge.

## Specification

On Aave V4 Ethereum, the payload targets the Risk Steward at [0x6f48d9Cdb8EE6E17c96B2d8Aec128af426A295c1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6f48d9Cdb8EE6E17c96B2d8Aec128af426A295c1). On Aave V4 Avalanche, it targets the Risk Steward at [0xd8d7AbC42c1c938BdEC94fF8da1b3cd5b7e3b107](https://snowscan.xyz/address/0xd8d7AbC42c1c938BdEC94fF8da1b3cd5b7e3b107). Both payloads apply the same configuration:

| Scope  | Parameter                        | Cooldown | Max change per update | Mode     |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------- | -------- |
| Hub    | `optimalUsageRatio`              | 36 hours | 3%                    | absolute |
| Hub    | `baseDrawnRate`                  | 36 hours | 3%                    | absolute |
| Hub    | `rateGrowthBeforeOptimal`        | 36 hours | 3%                    | absolute |
| Hub    | `rateGrowthAfterOptimal`         | 36 hours | 20%                   | absolute |
| Hub    | `addCap`                         | 36 hours | 100%                  | relative |
| Hub    | `drawCap`                        | 36 hours | 100%                  | relative |
| Spoke  | `collateralRisk`                 | 36 hours | 300%                  | absolute |
| Spoke  | `collateralFactor` (update)      | 72 hours | 0.5%                  | absolute |
| Spoke  | `maxLiquidationBonus` (update)   | 72 hours | 0.5%                  | absolute |
| Spoke  | `collateralFactor` (addition)    | 72 hours | 100%                  | absolute |
| Spoke  | `maxLiquidationBonus` (addition) | 72 hours | 0.5%                  | absolute |
| Spoke  | `targetHealthFactor`             | 72 hours | 5%                    | relative |
| Spoke  | `healthFactorForMaxBonus`        | 72 hours | 5%                    | relative |
| Spoke  | `liquidationBonusFactor`         | 72 hours | 5%                    | absolute |
| Oracle | `priceCapLst`                    | 72 hours | 5%                    | relative |
| Oracle | `priceCapStable`                 | 72 hours | 0.5%                  | relative |
| Oracle | `discountRatePendle`             | 48 hours | 0.025                 | absolute |

In addition, each Risk Steward is granted the `HUB_CONFIGURATOR_DOMAIN_ADMIN_ROLE` (200) and the `SPOKE_CONFIGURATOR_DOMAIN_ADMIN_ROLE` (400) on its network's AccessManager, with no execution delay. Without both roles the Risk Steward cannot reach the configurators and the configuration above has no effect.

Listings, spoke registrations, position manager updates, price sources, pause and freeze flags, borrowability, liquidation fees and interest rate strategy addresses remain governance-only and are out of the Risk Stewards' scope.
